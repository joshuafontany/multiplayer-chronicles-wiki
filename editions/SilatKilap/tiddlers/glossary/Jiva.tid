In Hinduism and Jainism, a ''jiva'' is a living being, or more specifically, the immortal essence or soul of a living organism (human, animal, fish or plant etc.) which survives physical death. It has a very similar usage to atma, but whereas atma refers to "the cosmic self", jiva is used to denote an individual 'living entity' or 'living being' specifically. To avoid confusion, the terms Paramatma and jivatma (also commonly spelled jeevatma) are used.

The word itself originates from the Sanskrit Jivás, with the root jīv- 'to breathe'. It has the same Indo-European root as the Latin word Vivus: "alive".

In the [[Bhagavad Gita]], the jiva is described as immutable, eternal, numberless and indestructible. It is said not to be a product of the material world (Prakrti), but of a higher 'spiritual' nature. At the point of physical death the jiva takes a new physical body depending on the karma and the individual desires and necessities of the particular jiva in question.
