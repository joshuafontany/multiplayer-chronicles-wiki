Palm up strike from underneath with the "short hand". A low strike/grab to the center of the body. Often mis-transliterated as [[Sangsot]], which has a related meaning.

Origin unclear, possible from Chinese //song// (ÈÄÅ), "to deliver, send, present", and the [[sat|?]] from "Sat, Sat, ~PliTok!" It may also be from Sundanese //sangsat//, "all nonsense, humbug, not to be believed. Ridiculous, deceptive.", due to its deceptive nature (see //sangsat// in [[Wikisource.org/A Dictionary of the Sunda language]]).
