A cannibalistic people from Sumatra of tremendous ferocity. They were in subservience to the Menangkebau and paid them tribute, and as such are a part of our cultural martial lineage.

Sometimes seen as primitives, they are sophisticated warriors, woodsmen and have a very complex social society. They were feared as raiders, coastal and river pirates as they preferred "long pig" to any other food source.

Their recipe is: //Chili, peanuts and a little lemon juice; strip the meat alive, moisten in the lemon juice and roll in the chili. Saut√© the meat and peanuts as the garnish. Serve immediately.// This is a preferred "trail food" as the ingredients are light and travel well.
