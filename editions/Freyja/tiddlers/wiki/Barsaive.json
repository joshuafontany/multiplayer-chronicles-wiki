        "text": "Barsaive was once one of the [[Theran Empire]]'s many provinces but a series of post-Scourge wars between [[Thera]] and various city-states of Barsaive have seen the former province secure its independence.\n\n\"The [[Therans]] named the province of Barsaive six hundred years ago, before [[the Scourge|The Scourge]] began. Even today the Therans consider Barsaive a province of their empire, though most Barsaivians give their allegiance to the dwarf kingdom of [[Throal]]. This stark contradiction between perceptions of Barsaive's people and its would be overlords creates much of the conflict between Thera and Barsaive.\" -- [[An Explorer's Guide to Barsaive]], p.6, contributed by [[Merrox; Master of the Hall of Records|Merrox]].\n\nBarsaive is bound by unique and fairly impassable features on all sides. To the south lies the [[Death's Sea]] of molten lava, to the east the mysterious Aras Sea, to the north the ancient [[Blood Wood]] and [[the Wastes|The Wastes]] border west side of the province. Another place of significance is the south-western corner of the province under the control of the Theran Empire which contains the ruins of the Theran's military outpost called [[Sky Point]] and a big, rich city of Vivane - now full of undead in the post [[Second Theran War]] era.",
