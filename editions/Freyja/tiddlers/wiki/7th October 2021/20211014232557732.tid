The PCs scout the back area of the temple and find the secret entrance. Hamilton notes a rope visible between the cracks of the secret door that seems to be holding it shut. Ava leaves 2 t'skrang crew to watch the marketplace in front of the temple as long into the night as possible. More wall patrols are noted, along with small deliveries of slaves by armed bands until late into the night.
