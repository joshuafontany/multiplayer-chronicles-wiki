[[Hamilton]]'s scribes ask around about the temple while shopping for supplies around the Low City's [[Port District|Highport/Port District]] (Research 6). They learn that the faction that controls  the Temple is not he Ork faction that controls most of the city. The Orks that serve as de-facto city guards all wear a yellow embroidered eye on their clothing. Most other "locals" wear a scrap of yellow cloth. The Slaver's Temple crew and all the slaver crews coming in and out of the temple all wear a piece of solid yellow clothing, like a tunic, cloak, etc.
