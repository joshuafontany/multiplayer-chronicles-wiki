[[Hamilton]], [[Ava Kvalheim]], and the Boatman t'skrang scout out the Temple entrances. They try to "sell" Ava's merchant hireling to the orks guarding the front gate, and find out that the Temple Slavers do not accept random sales. One must have an interview with "the Mistress of the Temple" in order to be on "the list". They are told to "fuck off." They notice orks, humans, skeletons, and a group of yellow-robed figures patrolling along the top of the Temple's ruined outer wall.
