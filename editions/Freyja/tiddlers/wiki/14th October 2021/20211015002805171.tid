[[Ava Kvalheim]] and [[Hamilton]] go to the docks to interview [[Sava Seabright]]. Ava brings along 75 silver from the party's fund to "smooth the introduction". They slip her 20 silver get descriptions of the slaver's ships operating out of the port. [[Hamilton]] asks if Sava can get anything written by one of the slaver captains to base a forgery on.
